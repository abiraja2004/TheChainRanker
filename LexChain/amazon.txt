No billionaire has had a better year than Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Bezos is the biggest dollar gainer on the 2017 World’s Billionaires List, in a year when 56 percentage of billionaires saw their fortunes increase. Bezos' net worth jumped by 27.6 billion in the past year more than the total net worth of all but the 24 richest billionaires. Amazon stock climbed 67 percentage in the past year in part because of the success of its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. With a net worth of 72.8 billion, Bezos is now the third richest billionaire in the world, behind Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett. Last year, Bezos cracked the ranks of the top 10 richest billionaires in the world for the first time, ranking fifth on Forbes 2016 World’s Billionaires List. Now he is two spots higher in the ranks and nearly 30 billion richer. A decade ago, on the 2007 Billionaires List, he had a net worth of 4.4 billion.
