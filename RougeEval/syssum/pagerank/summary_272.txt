President Reagan appointed an interagency group to deal with the drought and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng authorized farmers in drought parched counties in 13 states to harvest hay on idled crop land in the government's Conservation Reserve Program.
Before the drought began damaging crops this month, the year was shaping up as one of the best in the decade for rural industries that depend on farmers.
Few in farming expect the drought to trigger an agricultural recession, although more farmers could go bankrupt because of it.
"Before the drought we expected a very solid year" for farm lenders, says Mark Drabenstott, an economist at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank.
