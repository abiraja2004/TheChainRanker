How much more of an "investment" should American taxpayers make in the welfare system?
This is the question the House of Representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987.
The bill proposes $5.2 billion in new spending over five years, and most of that will increase benefits currently received by welfare recipients.
The proposed new spending on welfare should be viewed as an investment, say its proponents, led by Rep. Thomas Downey.
That might produce reprisals from voters who've watched their tax dollars build and maintain the welfare system, with little evident return on their investment.
