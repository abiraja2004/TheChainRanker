World Bank President Barber Conable was so well regarded during his 20-year career as a Republican congressman from New York that some journalists nicknamed him "H.R." -- for "highly respected." 
After a year and a half in office, he has failed to move the bank into a leadership role on the Third World debt problem.
"There surely is a much larger role for the World Bank in the debt problem than it has played so far, but they just can't get out ahead of the administration," he says.
