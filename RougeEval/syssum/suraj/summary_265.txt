While there is agreement in virtually every quarter that something needs to be done about welfare, disagreement remains over exactly what to do.
The White House has a formula for welfare reform, as do Sens.
Now the nation's governors are asking Washington to adopt their plan.
The conference's chairman, Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, even backed off earlier criticism of the administration's welfare plan, saying after the White House meeting, "I feel better about the prospects of welfare reform than I did yesterday." 
The most unattractive feature of the governors' welfare plan is its price tag -- up to $2 billion a year on top of the $100 billion-plus already devoted to assorted anti-poverty programs.
