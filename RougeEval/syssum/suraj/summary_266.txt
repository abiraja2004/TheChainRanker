Confounding predictions of its demise four years ago during the worst diamond slump since the 1930s, De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the South African concern that controls 80% of the world's uncut-diamond market, is thriving.
But De Beers not only halted a fall in rough-diamond prices, it raised them an average 14.5% last year.
De Beers managed the comeback by convincing diamond producers, dealers and the jewelry industry that its marketing muscle was indispensable.
"Selling diamonds is the business of dealers and jewelers; helping them to sell more is ours," says Stephen Lussier, a De Beers marketing executive.
