In his State of the Union address last January, President Reagan announced that welfare reform would be a priority of his administration in its final three years.
The president's convincing message raised hopes that something would finally be done to break the cycle of poverty and dependency that afflicts several million welfare families.
Americans have become increasingly exasperated by the enormous amount of money the federal government devotes each year to anti-poverty programs, with little apparent abatement in poverty.
The president correctly sensed that the public wants reform.
The president ought to challenge Congress to respond to his initiatives.
